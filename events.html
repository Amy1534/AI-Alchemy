											<h3>Ryan Murdock</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/ryan.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Ryan, also known as '@advadnoun' on Twitter, authored the 'BigSleep' Google Colab notebook and also pioneered the approach of combining VQGAN with CLIP to guide image generation. This was an important milestone in the community led development of text-to-image technologies. Ryan is a Machine Learning researcher & engineer interested in art, culture, and cognitive science. His passion is advocating for text-guided visual art as a compelling new medium.</p>

											<h3>Dr Mike Cook</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/mike2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Mike works at the intersection of automated game design and computational creativity – he’s interested in how computers can be autonomously creative in the field of game design, and how we can use AI to assist and analyse generative software written by humans. He gained his PhD from Imperial College in 2015, and in 2018 was awarded a Research Fellowship from the Royal Academy of Engineering, to research applications of automated game design to industry-scale game development at Queen Mary.</p>

											<h3>Dr Kate Compton</h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/kate2.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Dr Kate Compton (@galaxykate) is a long-time generative artist, inventor, programmer, and Assistant Professor of Instruction at Northwestern University. She wrote the first paper on procedural platform-game levels, generated the planets for the video game Spore, created the language Tracery which runs over 10000 community-made bots on Twitter, and invented an early phone-based AR system. Her mission is to design artificial intelligence to augment human creativity, and to create tools that bring AI into the hands of poets, artists, kids, and weirdos.</p>

										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/peeps/charlene.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Charlene Putney is an award-winning writer and teacher from Ireland. After school she spent 5 years mostly alone in a library getting a Masters degree in Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, and Greek. The logical next step was working at Google and Facebook in management positions for almost a decade. She then turned to the more creative side of tech and began writing for videogames in 2013, including writing for Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Baldur's Gate 3. She's currently living in Denmark and working on making machine learning more accessible to writers with her partner Martin Pichlmair - sign up for the beta at www.writewithlaika.com. She also teaches interactive fiction at university level and yoga on Tuesday evenings. Say hello to @alphachar!</p>
