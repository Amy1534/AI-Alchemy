											<h3>Simon Colton</h3>
											<p>Simon Colton is a professor of computational creativity, generative artist and app developer. He has academic appointments at Queen Mary University of London in the UK and at SensiLab of Monash University in Australia. He was previously an academic at Falmouth University, Goldsmiths College and Imperial College London. He is an AI researcher with 25 years of experience studying questions related to creativity in machines.

                                                He has worked on generative mathematics, bioinformatics, graphic design, visual art, music, creative language and videogame design projects. He has led projects leading to large software installations challenging assumptions about creativity, including The Painting Fool automated artist, the HR generative mathematics system(s), the WhatIf Machine fictional ideation engine, the Wevva casual game creator and the Art Done Quick visual art casual creator.

                                            <h3>Kate Compton</h3>
                                            <p>Dr Kate Compton (@galaxykate) is a long-time generative artist, inventor, programmer, and Assistant Professor of Instruction at Northwestern University.  She wrote the first paper on procedural platform-game levels, generated the planets for the video game Spore, created the language Tracery which runs over 10000 community-made bots on Twitter, and invented an early phone-based AR system. Her mission is to design artificial intelligence to augment human creativity, and to create tools that bring AI into the hands of poets, artists, kids, and weirdos.</p>

											<h3>Anna Jordanous</h3>
											<p>Dr Anna Jordanous is a senior lecturer in the School of Computing at the University of Kent. She is a member of the Computational Intelligence and Data Science research groups. Her research areas include computational creativity and its evaluation, music informatics, digital humanities, knowledge modelling, Semantic Web, and natural language processing. Primarily she works with computational creativity - the modelling, simulation or replication of creative activities and behaviour using computational means - with a focus on the question of how to evaluate claims of computer software being creative. As well as writing creative software to improvise music, Dr Jordanous has contributed a highly-cited standardised procedure for evaluating creative systems. She also uses music information retrieval and natural language processing in her work. </p>
