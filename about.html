										<p>AI Alchemy is a speaker series, an art practice and a new metaphor for conceptualizing AI. We are a team of researchers and artists based at the MIT Media Lab and the IGGI program at Queen Mary University London looking to explore new ways to interact with generative AI systems. </p>
										<p>Al·che·my is the process of transformation, creation, and combination. It is in this conceptual space that we frame the convergence of human and computational creativity within generative deep learning technologies, specifically text-to-image AI architectures. </p>
									    <p>Conceptual analogies can frame the way that people interact with technology and so can influence the way that they see potential applications of it. Our research has led us to metaphors of mediumship, alchemy and conjuring when analogising generative AI systems. This series of talks and interactive events aims to encapsulate these ideas through practice, but also through learning from others via talks and healthy debate.</p>

										<h3>Ziv Epstein</h3>
										<p>Zivvy Epstein is a late stage PhD student at the MIT Medis Lab in the Human Dynamics group.  His  work integrates aspects of design and computational social science to model and understand cooperative systems. He focuses on new challenges and opportunities that emerge from a digital society, particularly in the domains of artificial intelligence and social media.</p>

										<h3>Amy Smith</h3>
										<p>Amy is a third year PhD student on the IGGI program, based at Queen Mary University London. 
										She is working at the intersection of Computational Creativity, generative deep learning and user creativity and imagination. 
										She worked as a professional tattoo artist for several years before learning how to cod; consequently discovering a deep interest in generative AI algorithms. 
										She is currently a visiting research student at the MIT Media Lab, working in the Viral Communications group on symbiont intelligence. 
										Part of her project work has included building a Twitter bot named: '@artbhot' which leverages text to image technology to transform user tweets in to images and animations. 
										She is interested in understanding how easy access to this technology on social media can impact perceptions of creativity and also help to steer this technology in a positive direction. </p>
